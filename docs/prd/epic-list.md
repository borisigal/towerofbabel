# Epic List

## Epic 1: Foundation & Core Infrastructure (RESTRUCTURED - 7 Stories)
**Goal:** Establish complete project foundation including Next.js application setup, TypeScript configuration, Tailwind CSS, testing framework, Git repository, Vercel deployment pipeline with preview and production environments, PostgreSQL database with Prisma ORM and RLS policies, authentication system (magic link + Google OAuth), monitoring infrastructure (Redis + Sentry), cost protection circuit breakers, and a basic dashboard that validates the entire stack is operational and deployable.

**Stories:**
1. Story 1.1: Initialize Next.js Project with Testing Framework and Core Setup
2. Story 1.2: Set Up Vercel Deployment Pipeline
3. Story 1.3: Configure PostgreSQL Database with Prisma ORM and Security Policies
4. Story 1.4: Implement Authentication with Supabase Auth
5. Story 1.5A: Create Basic Dashboard and Infrastructure Validation
6. Story 1.5B: Set Up Monitoring Infrastructure (Vercel KV + Sentry)
7. Story 1.5C: Implement LLM Cost Protection Circuit Breakers

**Restructure Notes:** Originally 5 stories, restructured to 7 stories to fix critical sequencing issues (testing framework initialization, health-check route timing, RLS policy placement, monitoring infrastructure validation). See `EPIC-1-RESTRUCTURE-SUMMARY.md` for details.

## Epic 2: Interpretation Engine & LLM Integration
**Goal:** Implement the core interpretation functionality (inbound analysis) with LLM integration, dynamic emotion detection, and adaptive display logic (single vs. dual scores based on culture selection), delivering the primary user value proposition.

## Epic 3: Usage Tracking & Pricing Tiers
**Goal:** Build usage tracking, pricing tier enforcement (trial, pay-as-you-go, Pro), Lemon Squeezy integration for payments, and limit notifications to validate unit economics and enable monetization.

## Epic 4: Outbound Optimization & Quality Feedback
**Goal:** Deliver outbound message optimization with side-by-side comparison UI and thumbs up/down feedback mechanism for both inbound and outbound interpretations to complete bidirectional workflow and enable quality tracking.

## Epic 5: Privacy, Polish & Launch Readiness
**Goal:** Implement privacy badge, GDPR compliance features (data deletion, privacy policy), accessibility improvements (WCAG 2.1 AA), cross-browser testing, and PWA capabilities to ensure production readiness and build user trust.
