# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

Based on the Project Brief, here are the desired outcomes this PRD will deliver:

- Launch a specialized cross-cultural communication interpretation tool within 2-3 weeks
- Achieve 30%+ trial-to-paid conversion rate by providing superior value over free ChatGPT
- Reach 200+ paying subscribers ($24K ARR run rate) within 3 months of launch
- Validate sustainable unit economics with **80%+ gross margin** (keeping LLM costs minimal through usage limits and efficient provider selection)
- Establish category leadership in cultural interpretation before competitors enter (6-12 month window)
- Deliver measurable user value: users save 1+ hours/week on communication clarification
- Achieve 70%+ positive interpretation feedback rate demonstrating quality threshold

## Background Context

TowerOfBabel addresses a critical gap in the $3B cross-cultural communication market: 200M+ knowledge workers communicate in English across cultures daily but lack tools to decode cultural subtext beyond literal translation. While ChatGPT and Grammarly exist, neither specializes in cultural interpretation with purpose-built UX (emotion gauges showing "In their culture: Enthusiasm 3/10 → In yours: 6/10") or optimized workflows (10-second paste-and-go vs. 3-minute AI conversations).

The MVP focuses on web-first delivery with usage-based pricing (14-day trial with 10 messages, $10/month Pro tier with TBD message limit based on LLM cost benchmarking, $0.50 pay-per-use option) to validate unit economics before scaling. Privacy transparency—clearly disclosing which AI provider processes messages and their retention policy while storing zero message content ourselves—differentiates from competitors and builds trust for business communication use cases.
