| 2025-10-04 | 1.0 | Initial fullstack architecture creation with Supabase-native stack and critical risk mitigations | Winston (Architect) |

## Starter Template Decision

**Decision:** **Greenfield project** â€” Initialize from `create-next-app` with TypeScript + Tailwind + App Router

**Rationale:**
- PRD already specifies exact tech stack (Next.js 14+, TypeScript strict, Tailwind, Supabase, Vercel)
- 2-3 week timeline favors simplicity over learning starter template patterns
- Minimal dependencies reduces bundle size (< 300KB goal) and attack surface
- Full control over architecture decisions (no starter bloat to remove)
- Estimated time savings: 4-8 hours across Epic 1-5 (faster development with vanilla patterns)

**Constraints Imposed:**
- Manual setup of Supabase Auth, Prisma schema, Stripe integration (all well-documented)
- Full responsibility for architecture decisions (acceptable - that's this document's purpose)
