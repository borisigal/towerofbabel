# Summary

**Key Decisions:**
1. ✅ Supabase-native stack (Auth, PostgreSQL) - saves $420/year, 2-3 hour setup time
2. ✅ Greenfield Next.js 14 - faster iteration, full control
3. ✅ LLM Provider Adapter Pattern - enables Week 1 benchmarking
4. ✅ Privacy-first data model - zero message content storage
5. ✅ Critical risk mitigations in Epic 1 - JWT session, connection pool, cost circuit breaker

**Confidence:** 95% - Strongly aligned with PRD goals (2-3 weeks, 80% margin, privacy-first, 10s speed)

**Next Actions:**
1. Begin Epic 1 Story 1.1 (Initialize Next.js project)
2. Week 1 LLM benchmarking (OpenAI vs. Anthropic vs. xAI vs. Google)
3. Monitor cost metrics daily during development
