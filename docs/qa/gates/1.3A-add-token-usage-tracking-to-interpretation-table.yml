# Non-functional requirements validation
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "No security concerns. Token counts contain no PII. Nullable fields enable graceful degradation. Privacy-first design maintained."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Appropriate index strategy (no new indexes for metric fields). Nullable fields add minimal overhead. Migration is fast (~50ms)."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Additive migration = zero downtime. Backward compatible (NULL defaults). Clean atomic SQL."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Exceptional documentation. Clear field names. Comprehensive inline comments. Perfect pattern matching."

# Recommendations by priority
recommendations:
  immediate:  # Must fix before marking story Done
    - action: "Commit migration file to version control"
      rationale: "AC #3 requires migration committed to Git. Blocks production deployment without this."
      refs:
        - "prisma/migrations/20251020_add_token_tracking/"
      command: "git add prisma/migrations/20251020_add_token_tracking/ && git commit -m 'feat: Story 1.3A - Add token tracking migration'"

    - action: "Commit all Story 1.3A changes"
      rationale: "Schema, seed, and documentation changes must be committed together with migration"
      refs:
        - "prisma/schema.prisma"
        - "prisma/seed.ts"
        - "docs/stories/1.3.story.md"
      command: "git add prisma/ docs/stories/ && git commit -m 'feat: Story 1.3A - Add token tracking to Interpretation table'"

  future:  # Nice to have, can be addressed later
    - action: "Verify health-check route works unchanged"
      rationale: "Low risk (no code changes), but AC #11 requires verification"
      refs:
        - "app/api/health/route.ts"
      command: "npm run dev && curl http://localhost:3000/api/health"

# Implementation strengths (what went well)
strengths:
  - "Reference-quality schema design (nullable Int? fields with clear rationale)"
  - "Clean, atomic migration SQL (3 ALTER TABLE statements)"
  - "Comprehensive documentation in Story 1.3 Dev Notes (lines 472-501)"
  - "Realistic seed data (250 input, 450 output, 150 cached tokens)"
  - "Perfect pattern consistency (Int? matches String? for feedback field)"
  - "Appropriate index strategy (no unnecessary indexes for metric fields)"
  - "TypeScript strict mode compliance (no errors)"
  - "Prisma schema validation passing"
  - "Privacy-first design maintained (no PII in token counts)"
  - "Forward-thinking design (supports multi-provider token structures)"

# Review notes
review_notes:
  code_quality: "EXCELLENT - This is reference-quality schema design work that demonstrates mastery of Prisma patterns, database design, and privacy-first architecture."

  implementation_highlights:
    - "Nullable Int? fields perfectly match the existing String? pattern for optional feedback"
    - "Migration SQL is clean and atomic (3 simple ALTER TABLE statements)"
    - "Seed script includes realistic token values that reflect actual LLM usage patterns"
    - "Documentation explains WHY decisions were made, not just WHAT was implemented"
    - "Forward-thinking design supports both Anthropic (with caching) and OpenAI (without)"

  process_gaps:
    - "Migration file not committed to Git (AC #3 - BLOCKING)"
    - "All modified files uncommitted (schema.prisma, seed.ts, 1.3.story.md)"
    - "Health-check not tested (AC #11 - LOW PRIORITY)"

  risk_assessment: "LOW - Process issue only, implementation is correct and complete"

  next_steps:
    - "1. Commit all Story 1.3A files to Git"
    - "2. Optionally verify health-check route"
    - "3. Update story status to Done"
    - "4. Gate will move to PASS once files are committed"
