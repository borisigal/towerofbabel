# Detailed Validation Results
validation_summary: |
  Comprehensive validation performed on Vercel deployment infrastructure:

  ✅ AC #1: Vercel project created and linked to GitHub repository (borisigal/towerofbabel)
  ✅ AC #2: Automatic preview deployments configured for all branches with unique URLs
  ✅ AC #3: Production deployment configured for main branch (https://towerofbabel.vercel.app)
  ✅ AC #4: 16 environment variables configured in Vercel (Production + Preview environments)
  ✅ AC #5: Successful deployment verified - production URL accessible
  ✅ AC #6: Build logs show successful Next.js build with zero errors
  ✅ AC #7: Health-check route verified returning 200 OK with correct JSON structure

  LIVE PRODUCTION VERIFICATION (2025-10-14T20:42:26Z):
  ✅ curl https://towerofbabel.vercel.app/api/health → 200 OK
  ✅ Response: {"status": "ok", "timestamp": "2025-10-14T20:42:26.624Z", "database": "pending"}
  ✅ Database field correctly shows "pending" (Story 1.3 not yet implemented)

strengths: |
  - Production deployment pipeline fully operational with zero-downtime deployments
  - Automatic CI/CD integration via Git (push to main → production, feature branches → preview)
  - Health-check endpoint verified working in production environment
  - Preview deployment workflow tested end-to-end (test/deployment-check branch)
  - All 16 environment variables configured with appropriate placeholder values
  - Environment variables properly scoped (Production, Preview, Development)
  - Comprehensive deployment documentation added to README.md including:
    * Production and preview deployment workflows
    * Environment variable management
    * Health-check verification instructions
    * Deployment protection explanation
    * Troubleshooting guide for common issues
  - Dev Agent correctly adapted to Lemon Squeezy (not Stripe) per Story 1.1 migration
  - Build process validated: TypeScript compilation, ESLint, Next.js build all passing
  - Vercel Deployment Protection enabled on preview deployments (authentication required)
  - Next Steps section in README updated to reflect Stories 1.1-1.2 completion

observations: |
  - Task 4 specification lists Stripe environment variables, but implementation correctly used Lemon Squeezy variables (following Story 1.1 migration). This shows good judgment and awareness of codebase state.
  - No custom domain configured (optional per AC #3, appropriate for MVP)
  - vercel.json file not created (not required - Vercel auto-detection works perfectly)

next_steps: |
  Ready to proceed to Story 1.3 (PostgreSQL Database with Prisma).
  Deployment pipeline will automatically handle:
  - Database migration deployments via `prisma migrate deploy`
  - Environment variable updates for Supabase credentials
  - Health-check endpoint enhancement to test database connectivity

deployment_evidence: |
  **Production Environment:**
  - URL: https://towerofbabel.vercel.app
  - Health-check: VERIFIED (200 OK, correct JSON response)
  - Build: SUCCESS (TypeScript, ESLint, Next.js build all passing)
  - Repository: GitHub (borisigal/towerofbabel)

  **Preview Environment:**
  - Workflow: TESTED (test/deployment-check branch created, unique URL generated)
  - Protection: ENABLED (Vercel authentication required)
  - Auto-updates: CONFIRMED (commits update preview deployment)

  **Environment Variables:**
  - Total configured: 16 (matches .env.local.example)
  - Scope: Production, Preview, Development
  - Placeholders for future stories: DATABASE_URL, SUPABASE_*, LEMONSQUEEZY_*, LLM keys, KV_*, SENTRY_DSN
  - Actual values: Cost limits, LLM_PROVIDER default, PRO_MESSAGE_LIMIT, NODE_ENV

  **Build Verification:**
  - TypeScript compilation: PASS
  - ESLint checks: PASS
  - Next.js build: PASS
  - Asset optimization: AUTO (Vercel)
  - Global CDN deployment: AUTO (Vercel Edge Network)
