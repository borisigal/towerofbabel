additional_notes: |
  Story 2.4 achieves two critical objectives:

  1. **Fixes Story 2.3 Build Blocker**: Successfully resolved the `any` types in InterpretationResult.tsx by fixing the Emotion interface type mismatch. Production build now passes with 0 errors.

  2. **Implements Accessible Emotion Display**: Created WCAG 2.1 AA compliant EmotionGauge component with multiple accessibility layers (text labels, numerical scores, intensity labels, progress bars with aria-labels).

  **Code Quality Assessment:**

  The implementation demonstrates excellent quality:
  - Perfect TypeScript compliance (zero `any` types)
  - Comprehensive JSDoc documentation
  - WCAG 2.1 AA compliant accessibility
  - Semantic HTML for screen readers
  - Responsive design with Tailwind breakpoints
  - Clean separation of concerns (reusable EmotionGauge component)

  **Test Failure Analysis:**

  87 out of 88 tests fail with "React is not defined" error. Root cause: EmotionGauge.tsx and InterpretationResult.tsx missing `import React from 'react';` statement.

  Modern React (17+) does not require React import for JSX in production (tree-shaking optimization), but Vitest/jsdom test environment still needs it. This is a test configuration issue, not a production code issue.

  **Impact:**
  - Production: NO IMPACT - build passes successfully
  - Development: Tests cannot verify component behavior
  - Story 2.4 DoD: Blocks "80%+ test coverage" requirement

  **Resolution:** Add React import to both component files (2-minute fix).

  **Manual Testing for Story 2.3 Task 19:**

  Based on Story 2.3's Task 19 manual testing checklist:
  - ‚úÖ Trial user testing completed (dev server, exhausted limit test)
  - ‚ùå PAYG user testing incomplete
  - ‚ùå Same-culture interpretation incomplete
  - ‚ùå Cross-culture interpretation incomplete
  - ‚úÖ Error scenarios tested

  **Recommendation:** Complete Task 19 manual testing after fixing React import issue.
