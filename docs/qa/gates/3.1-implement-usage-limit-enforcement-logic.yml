additional_notes: |
  This is an excellent implementation that enhances the usage limit system with trial expiration and Pro tier monthly resets. The code demonstrates:

  1. **Perfect Pattern Compliance:** Database-as-source-of-truth pattern strictly enforced (queries trial_start_date and messages_reset_date from DB, NOT JWT)

  2. **Excellent Architecture:**
     - On-demand Pro reset (seamless user experience)
     - Cron job as backup (catches missed resets)
     - Fail-safe design (cron errors logged but don't crash job)
     - Circuit breaker on all database operations

  3. **Comprehensive Error Responses:**
     - TRIAL_EXPIRED: Includes days_elapsed, trial_end_date
     - LIMIT_EXCEEDED (trial): Includes messages_used, messages_limit
     - LIMIT_EXCEEDED (pro): Includes messages_used, messages_limit, reset_date
     - Enables rich UI feedback for Story 3.2

  4. **Flexible Configuration:**
     - TRIAL_DAYS_LIMIT env var (default 14)
     - PRO_MESSAGE_LIMIT env var (default 100)
     - CRON_SECRET for authorization
     - Easy to adjust without code changes

  5. **Production-Ready:**
     - All 20 tests passing (100% success rate)
     - Production build successful (0 errors)
     - Comprehensive audit logging
     - Vercel cron configured correctly

  **Integration Test Results:**
  - Cron job authorization: ✓ 401 returned for invalid secret
  - Pro user reset: ✓ messages_used_count = 0, messages_reset_date updated
  - Multiple users: ✓ Resets all eligible users
  - Error handling: ✓ Failed resets logged but job continues
  - Audit trail: ✓ All resets logged with user details

  **Trial Expiration Logic:**
  - Checked BEFORE message limit (time-based takes precedence)
  - Clear error messaging with days_elapsed
  - Edge case handling (14 days = allowed, 15 days = blocked)

  **Pro Reset Logic:**
  - Automatic on-demand during interpretation request
  - Cron job backup at midnight UTC daily
  - Next reset_date calculated as +30 days
  - Will integrate with Lemon Squeezy subscription data in Story 3.4

  This story is production-ready and ready to merge.
