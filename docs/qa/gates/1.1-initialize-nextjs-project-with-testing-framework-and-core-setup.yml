  ✅ README.md updated to reference Lemon Squeezy payment keys
  ✅ Project structure updated to /lib/lemonsqueezy/
  ✅ Dev Notes section consistently references Lemon Squeezy throughout
  ✅ Change Log documents migration (version 1.2)

strengths: |
  - All critical requirements met without deviation
  - CRITICAL security control (JWT metadata prevention) correctly implemented
  - TypeScript strict mode with all required compiler options (strict, noUncheckedIndexedAccess, noImplicitReturns, noFallthroughCasesInSwitch)
  - Comprehensive environment variable template covering all future epics
  - Proper Server Components by default (no 'use client' unless needed)
  - All 4 tests passing in test suite
  - Excellent documentation quality in README.md
  - Package-lock.json properly committed for reproducible builds
  - Successful migration from Stripe to Lemon Squeezy payment provider (all references updated consistently)

observations: |
  - Vitest shows CJS deprecation warning (cosmetic, no functional impact - severity: low)
  - No integration tests yet (acceptable for initial setup story)
  - No CI/CD checks yet (acceptable for Story 1.1, will be added with Vercel deployment in 1.2)

next_steps: |
  Ready to proceed to Story 1.2 (Vercel Deployment).
  Health-check endpoint will be used to verify deployment success.
