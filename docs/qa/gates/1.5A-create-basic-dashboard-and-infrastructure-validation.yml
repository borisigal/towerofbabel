# CRITICAL RISK VALIDATION
# ============================================
critical_risks:
  - risk_id: "RISK_1"
    description: "JWT Session Delay After Payment - Paid users blocked for up to 1 hour after upgrade"
    mitigation: "Database-as-source-of-truth pattern"
    validation_status: VALIDATED
    evidence: |
      ✅ CRITICAL integration test PASSED
      ✅ Dashboard queries database for tier/usage (NOT JWT)
      ✅ Pattern documented in code comments
      ✅ findUserById() fetches fresh data from database

      Test proved:
      - JWT can have stale tier='trial'
      - Database has fresh tier='pro'
      - Dashboard displays database tier (Pro), NOT JWT tier (Trial)

      This ensures paid users get IMMEDIATE access after upgrade.

      **DECISION: CONDITIONAL PASS (95/100)**

      **Summary:**
      Story 1.5A implementation is EXCEPTIONAL with perfect code quality, comprehensive
      documentation, and CRITICAL integration test passing. All 10 acceptance criteria
      validated via code review and automated testing.

      **Strengths:**
      ✅ CRITICAL integration test PASSED (validates Risk #1 mitigation)
      ✅ Database-as-source-of-truth pattern implemented perfectly
